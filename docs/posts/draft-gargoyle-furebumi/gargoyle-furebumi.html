<h2>Improving Upon The Foundation</h2>


<p>Around the time of the release of Furebumi, Gargoyle was merely a young band that had yet to leave behind their rich legacy. In other words, the quartet took on the mighty task of crafting a followup
to Misogi. For thrash bands that had just left the 80s, this kind of task was of the utmost difficulty. Dozens of bands faced a significant quality drop as the 90s rolled in.  Against all odds, Gargoyle 
somehow completely defied this trend. Even putting aside the context of thrash bands sucking in the 90s, crafting a followup to any album as diabolical as Misogi would have been incredibly difficult. The 
Japanese madmen did not settle for simply matching the ingenuity of Misogi. Instead, the second album, Furebumi, goes the extra mile and improves upon what came before.</p>

<p>To put it in an apt analogy, Misogi laid down the foundation for the core of Garogyle's sound, but Furebumi constructed the beautiful building that sits on top of it. The second album takes the core sound 
from the debut, but develops it and establishes the blueprint that would be used in later Gargoyle albums. The band's sound matures greatly, and their songwriting steps up a notch. Like its predecessor, 
Furebumi mostly ignores the confines of genre boundaries, and the guys pretty much just play whatever they want. Sure, Gargoyle is undeniably rooted in thrash metal, but that doesn't stop some folk, 
neoclassical leads, or even funk from popping up from time to time.</p>

<p>And speaking of folk, that's exactly how the album begins. 誄歌〜Prologue〜 has the nice touch of sitar before seamlessly transitioning into a bonafide thrash metal song. The beautiful sitar work 
juxtaposed with Toshi's wandering basslines and some backing guitar is one of the best folk-to-metal transitional sections I've ever heard. When the songs kicks into a soaring dual-lead melody, 
you know you're in for something special.</p>

<p>Of course, Gargoyle is a very high quality band, so the rest of the numbers here kick ass too. The next song on here is, ときめき, which is just classic weird Gargoyle.
