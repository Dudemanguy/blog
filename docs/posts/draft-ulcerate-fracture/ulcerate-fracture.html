<p>Ulcerate is one of the most well-known and exemplary examples of "dissonant metal". Of course, they weren't the very first band to write primarily dissonant material (Gorguts and Deathspell Omega say "hi"), but their usage of dissonance and the style of death metal they play is among the most unusual and experimental. What's particularly curious about the debut album is that it came essentially completely out of nowhere. All of the material before this is basically solid brutal/technical death metal with no hint at the style the band would later pioneer and become famous for. Of Fracture and Failure is more or less the foundation that all future Ulcerate works spring from, and it also happens to be among my favorite in their discography.</p>
