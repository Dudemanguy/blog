	<h2>Time for a Change</h2>
	<em>March 16, 2021</em>
</div>

<p>Once again, my blog posting has ceased to a halt. It seems to happen in a cycle every few years. I have a nice, short burst of activity before fading away. I always tell my self that next time I'll be more diligent, but it never seems to happen. This time hopefully it'll finally be different. I've been doing some thinking recently on this subject. Writing things from my mind unto some form is definitely quite satisfying, and it's something I don't do enough. It's a good exercise for your mind to put your thoughts into words. In general, I would prefer to stay away from more controversial subjects. Not because I lack opinions. Quite the contrary, I just don't feel like getting cancelled.</p>

<p>With that said, I feel less of a passion and urge to do album reviews like I've done in years past. I don't dislike the format, but admittedly it is a highly dated practice in a time when anyone can quickly listen to something and judge a for for themselves. I do actually have a few drafts lying around (one is like 99% complete) that I may post anyway, but its a format I'm going to stop doing. I want to start talking about music in a more general sense. I'd like to change the broaden the focus to certain bands, scenes, and such. I think that will have more lasting value.</p>

<p>No promises of course, but I hope the change in direction will inspire me to write more things. Who knows if anyone ever reads this page anyway, but hopefully it will still be interesting.</p>
