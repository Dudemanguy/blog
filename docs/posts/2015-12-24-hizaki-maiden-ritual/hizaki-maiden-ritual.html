<h2>The Cutest Guitar Shredder</h2>

<span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: small">
<p>Hizaki's big break and claim to fame was the power metal sensation Versailles, but he was actually a pretty prolific musician before those days. When he started his solo project, Hizaki wasn't exactly a veteran in the visual kei but certainly not a newcomer. Maiden Ritual is his first solo EP, but his unmistakable guitar and songwriting style is written all over this. This is a fairly low budget affair, and it's pretty obvious in the drum programming. There's that low budget, underground visual kei feel to the whole thing which is quite honestly a charm point for me. It's perhaps unfair, but simply the knowledge that this is music made by Hizaki when he was pretty much a nobody makes this more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Not counting the intro track, it's just a 4 song affair. <em>Ritual</em> and <em>tragic serenade</em> feature guest vocals from Fu-ki (of the visual kei band Blood). He has a fairly standard voice, but it fits perfectly with the music.  The overall feel is slightly rough around the edges (perhaps due to the production), and there's a bit more indie-style visual kei in the riffage here. But stylistically, it's basically the same kind of power metal that anyone familiar with Versailles or Jupiter would expect just cast into a more "underground" context. The songs with the guest vocals are both quite good, but the best part of the EP are the two instrumental tracks at the end.</p>

<p>What makes Hizaki such a great guitarist is both his skill and his ability to craft highly melodic, ear-pleasing solos and leads. Both <em>Lunar Eclipse</em> and <em>Requiem</em> demonstrate this perfectly. Of course, you know he could just shred his brains out 24/7, but that doesn't happen here. The two instrumentals are absolutely fun to listen to. Hizaki plays a bunch of neoclassical melodies and leads, but always tastefully and in a controlled manner. Admittedly, the backing tracks are nothing too special, but the lead is what's really important and it's absolutely ace. It's a short and sweet little EP and anyone who enjoys Versailles or Jupiter would also dig this one.</p>

<p>Rating: 85/100</p>
