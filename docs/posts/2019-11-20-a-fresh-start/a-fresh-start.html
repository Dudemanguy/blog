<p>Looks like I'm heading back into the blogging world.</p>
<p>I do actually have a couple of crappy blogger sites where I have a decent amount of stuff written down, but it's time to move on. Blogger is owned by Google (yikes), is kind of annoying to use, and I started those way back before I was decent at programming. Of course, some smartass will point out that github is owned by Microsoft (far from a benevolent force), but at least it's all FOSS and I'm in total control. Well okay, I have to obey Github's <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> and their <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, so I'm not really free.</p>

<p>Whatever, I don't think I'll be heading into any sort of controversial topics so it should be fine. Using git to manage and update a webpage is very appealing and very convenient for me so this will be the best option. This webpage will be very simple and minimal. I loathe the world of bloated javascript and garbage javascript frameworks that have been forced upon us. I will keep it clean and simple: only HTML and CSS. I may use javascript to incorporate a search feature sometime in the future, but that is about the limit of it. This page should be minimal, simple, and fast. That's the goal. I don't even want to use one of those fancy markdown generators.</p>

<p>The most obvious thing to do is to start reposting my old blog material over here. I had separated them based on Western and Japanese music, but that was dumb. I'm just going to lump everything together now. And maybe the occasional tech topic or something can be thrown in as well. I'll try to keep this page semi-active with new material. Having somewhere to write my thoughts is nice.</p>

<p>Update: All of my old reviews have been transferred here. The dates that they were originally written will be used as the dates for the blog (i.e. all the old stuff will count as posts before this one). Hopefully someone out there finds at least some of it interesting to read.</p>
