		<h2>About Me</h2>
	</div>
	<p>Around the internet, my handle is typically "Dudemanguy". I like metal/rock music, programming/tech, and the stereotypical otaku crap (anime/manga/VN/etc).</p>
	<p>In the past, I've had some crappy blogspots, but now I want to migrate to something with more direct control and freedom. Primarily, my postings here will be music-related (specifically album reviews),
	but I may post something else if I so desire.</p>
	<p>I'm relatively active in a few different communities, so I won't list them all but here's a few. On the music side of things, I moderate <a href="https://japanesemetalforum.com/index.php">Japanese 
	Metal Forum</a> (specialized forum for Japanese rock/metal) and <a href="https://revelationofdoom.com/">Revelation of Doom</a> (a general forum for metal music especially extreme metal). I also contribute
	to <a href="https://forcesofsteel.net/forums/">Forces of Steel</a> which is another general metal forum.</p>
	<p>For software, you can, of course, look at my <a href="https://github.com/Dudemanguy">github</a> profile to see what projects I contribute to. I also maintain s6 packages for <a href="https://artixlinux
	.org/">Artix Linux</a>, a systemd-free fork of Arch that supports openrc, runit, and s6 as init systems.
