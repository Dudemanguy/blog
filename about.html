	<h2>About Me</h2>
</div>

<p>Around the internet, my handle is typically "Dudemanguy". I like metal/rock music, programming/tech, and the stereotypical otaku crap (anime/manga/VN/etc). As you might guess, I have a strong interest in Japanese metal/rock, but there are plenty of western artists I love as well. In the past, I've had some crappy blogspots, but it's time to migrate to something with more direct control and freedom. Primarily, my postings here will be music-related (specifically album reviews), but I may post about something else (like tech) on occasion.</p>

<p>I'm relatively active in a few different communities, so I won't list them all but here's a few. On the music side of things, I moderate <a href="https://japanesemetalforum.com/index.php">Japanese Metal Forum</a> (specialized forum for Japanese metal/rock) and <a href="https://revelationofdoom.com/">Revelation of Doom</a> (a general forum for metal music especially extreme metal). I also contribute to <a href="https://forcesofsteel.net/forums/">Forces of Steel</a> which is another general metal forum. For software, you can, of course, look at my <a href="https://github.com/Dudemanguy">Github</a> profile to see what projects I contribute to. I also maintain s6 packages for <a href="https://artixlinux.org/">Artix Linux</a>, a systemd-free fork of Arch that supports openrc, runit, and s6 as init systems.</p>
